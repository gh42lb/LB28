LB8, LB28, LB2Q & LB3Q

A new modulation and phase extraction technique for digital communication via electromagnetic waves. 

"During development and testing of the LB28 I3 modes that utilize pulse train standing waves, specifically the testing of fixed absolute phase recovery with extrapolation, it has become apparent that not only are these effective techniques for phase recovery, but that the signal produced by the interposed three phase signal generator is in fact a quantized time-scale hologram with some very useful properties. These include:

* increased resilience to phase noise
* characters in the message having the appearance of being locked together or entangled thus eliminating phase drift
* ability to take multiple samples from the hologram to further enhance noise resilience by averaging out the noise.
